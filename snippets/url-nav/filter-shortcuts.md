# Navigation filter

Shortcuts to use in the filter to quickly navigate:

- tablename.list - Navigate to the list of records for this table
- tablename.form - Open up an empty form to create a new record on this table
- tablename.config - Navigate to the Configurations view for this table
  - Quicker than navigation from form header > Configure > All
- tablename.filter - Similar to .list but shows the condition builder instead of return all records
  - Safe and useful for navigating to large tables, such as syslog.

> **HINT:** Capitalising the shortcut (e.g. .LIST) will open up the result into a new browser tab/window.
