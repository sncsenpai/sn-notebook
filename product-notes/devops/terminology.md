| DevOps                             | The cultural movement of communication, collaboration and integration between software developers and IT operations. |
| Continual Integration (CI)         | The process of automating the build and testing of code every time a team member commits changes to version control. |
| Continual Development (CD)         | The ability to get changes of all types into production, safely and quickly in a sustainable way. |
| Pipeline                           | Defined set of stages that software goes through to deliver value to a customer. |
| Microservices                      | An architectural approach that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services, allowing Dev teams to rapidly build without breaking the entire application. |
| Infrastructure as Code (IaC)       | The management of infrastructure in a descriptive model, uses the same versioning as DevOps teams use for source code. |
| Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) | A service model that delivers computer infrastructure on an outsourced basis to support enterprise operations. |
| Monitoring and Logging             | A process of examining audit logs for indications of activities and metrics relating to the usage and health of a system and applications. |
| Webhook                            | User-defined HTTP callback to an endpoint on an external system of actions. Example: SCM webhook to notify an orchestration tool that a commit has happened and the pipeline should be started. |
| Artifact                           | Deployable component of an application generated by a Continuous Improvement (CI) build. |
