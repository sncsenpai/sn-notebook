# Post Implementation Review

## What is a Post Implementation Review (PIR)

A post implementation review (PIR) is a process for evaluating a Change Request that identifies the root cause, contributing factors, and opportunities for improvement. Roles involved in the PIR process include the Change Implementer, the Change Approver, and CAB.

PIRs are not necessarily conducted for failed implementations of a Change Request only. They can also apply to resolving issues identified during the ELS period following a recent go-live, and Incident fixes (Post Incident Reviews are conducted after a Major Incident).

## Considerations for a PIR

- Did the change have the desired effect and meet the stated outcomes?
- Are users satisfied with the results?
- Are there any shortcomings or undesirable side effects?
- Was there a proper allocation of resources to implement the change?
- Was the Change Request implemented on time and within budget?
- If applicable, did the backout plan function correctly?
- Was the Change Request properly categorised? If not, adjust as required.
- Each Change Request can have only one post-implementation review.

## Who should be in the review?

It is recommended that the PIR is considered an independent body not involved in the change process to identify failings. This is owned by the Change Management team, with input from key stakeholders.

If the Change Request was to implement a fix for a Major Incident (for example) a separate Post Incident Review is conducted. However, it is recommended to foster collaboration by involving the Change Management team in the Post Incident Review. To avoid duplicating effort:

- Clearly define the focus areas
- Foster collaboration between teams
- Consolidate findings

## What to cover in the review?

There is no defined method or model, however the following questions and points are usually covered

- Type of review
  - Statutory or non statutory
- Stakeholders involved in PIR
- PIR Method
  - Surveys, user groups meetings, etc.
- Functional and operational tests
  - Operational tests
  - User tests
  - Summary of Test results
- Actual implementation
  - Start and End
  - Compare against planned start and end
- Acceptance Tests
  - Start and End
  - Date/time of acceptance
- Time and effort
  - Actual time and effort for the implementation
- Statements as to the achievement of objectives
  - Objectives of the Change achieved?
  - Where necessary, with which restrictions?
- Cost, time and effort adhered to for the implementation?
- Summary of findings arising from the implementation and lessons in order to avoid future mistakes
  - Successful changes
    - What went well?
    - What can be improved?
    - What doesn't need to be done next time?
    - Is it a good candidate for Standard Change?
  - If unsuccessful:
    1. *Root Cause of Unsuccessful Change*: Technical background, investigation, and explanation. May be redacted for some reports.
    2. How was the event detected?
    3. What was the business impact of the unsuccessful change?
    4. Contributing factors leading to the unsuccessful change
    5. Remediation steps to resolve the unsuccessful change
    6. *Timeline*: A timeline of events that led to the unsuccessful change
    7. Was the failure major or critical?
- Mitigations and Lessons Learned
- Are there opportunity for improvements?
- Additional review comments/feedback
- Action items
- Closure date of the Change Record

## Best Practices for Conducting a PIR

- Define clear objectives
  - Clearly define the purpose and objectives of the PIR.
- Select the right participants
  - Include key representatives from different areas and relevant stakeholders.
- Create a blame-free environment
  - Encourage open and honest discussions so participants feel safe to share experiences and insights without fear or blame or retribution.
- Establish ground rules
  - Ensure the review is constructive and productive by maintaining confidentiality, actively listening to others, and stay focused on the objectives.
- Identify root causes
  - Looks for issues that may have contributed to the failures, such as gaps in processes, or inadequate resources.

## Expected outcomes

- Accountability and transparency
  - Conducting a PIR is a structured and unbiased manner helps establish and improve trust with stakeholders.
- Continuous improvement
  - Based on the ITIL principle of continual service improvement. It helps to identify bottlenecks, inefficiencies, or gaps in processes and services and provides a basis for further enhancements to processes and technology.
- Compliance and auditing
  -  A PIR provides documented evidence of the implementation process and outcomes, which can be important for compliance with regulatory requirements or for audit purposes.
