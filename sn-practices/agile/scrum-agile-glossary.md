## Core Terms

| Term                                           | Definition                                                   |
| :--------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Agile                                          | An umbrella term for processes that are known for being 'agile', such as Scrum, XP, Kanban, etc. |
| [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) | **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools **Working software** over comprehensive documentation **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation **Responding to change** over following a plan That is, while there is value in the items on the right, **we value the items on the left more.** |
| Scrum                                          | An agile, team-based model of production that describes how a team produces a Product or Product Increment. |
| Kanban                                         | A method of organising and managing the work for delivering services to customers. The main strength of Kanban (from a Scrum point of view) is that its Planning is continuous, which makes it more likely to keep up with reality, and hence more agile. |
| Agile User Story                               | A **user story** is a tool used in Agile software development to capture a description of a software feature from an **end-user** perspective. The **user story** describes the type of **user**, what they want and why. A **user story** helps to create a simplified description of a requirement. |

## Roles in Scrum

| Term          | Definition                                                   |
| :------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Product Owner | Promotes the product vision and prioritises the product backlog to maximise the product's functionality and value for the customer. |
| Scrum Master  | Effectively coaches the development team, facilitates events, and eliminates distractions interfering with the team's progress. |
| Scrum Team    | Remained focus on completing the deliverables in increments (completed product functionality at the end of each sprint) and producing a superior final product. |

## Scrum Activities

| Term                 | Definition                                                   |
| :------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Daily Scrum          | Also called a **Daily Standup**. A 15-minute or less session to discuss what was worked on since the last stand-up, the plan for what will be worked on next and any blockers that need attention. |
| Sprint Review        | A review with the Product Owner and Stakeholders of the results produced at the end of a Sprint. Sometimes called a **Show-and-Tell** or Showback. |
| Sprint Retrospective | An internal conversation about improving *how* the Team does its work, at the end of a Sprint. |
| Sprint Planning      | A session with the Product Owner to determine what results should be produced during the next Sprint. Usually held at the end of a Sprint in preparation for the next Sprint. Typically, they commit to the top ranked stories first. The product owner should be present to answer any questions. |
| Scrum of Scrums      | In a multi-scrum-team environment this is a meeting held *after* the individual Scrum Teams' Daily Scrums. The meeting will consist of representatives of each Scrum Team, to achieve **cross-collaboration**. |

## Scrum Framework

| Term                | Definition                                                   |
| :------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Scrum Team          | There is one team in Scrum called the Scrum Team (or sometimes just "Team"). It is a small, self-organised, self-contained, value-driven group. It can consist of developers, testers and other skills to accomplish the goal. |
| Product Backlog     | List of work that must be implemented, as part of achieving specific outcomes. Backlog contains work related to new features, enhancements to existing features, and other activities of product development. Backlog is considered as the single source of work for a product or team. Anything that is not included in the backlog would not be prioritized for development. |
| Sprint Backlog      | Scope of work for a sprint. Product owners and their development teams use the sprint planning activity to review their backlog and decide on the stories to be picked up for a sprint. |
| Sprint              | The team has a Sprint (typically 1 - 4 weeks long) to accomplish progress towards work objectives. |
| Sprint Backlog Item | The item from the Sprint Backlog that Scrum Team works on during the Sprint. **Note**: This is still referred to as Story in the ServiceNow Agile Development 2.0 application. |

## Story Organisation

| Term       | Definition                                                   |
| :--------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Release    | A release has a start and end date during which several development iterations are completed. Releases are created by a product owner and contain user stories, sometimes from multiple products and can also involve multiple teams. The stories associated to a release form its release backlog. |
| Product    | Entity to organise themes, epics, and stories of similar functionality into a single context. A product represents an item or a feature that is to be developed and released to the market. |
| Epic       | Epics or Epic Stories are defined as large **User Stories** that would be hard to estimate in this form or hard to complete within one **Iteration**. Epic Stories are usually not very highly prioritized and are waiting to be broken down into smaller components. |
| Theme      | An Agile term, Themes help you identify common characteristics between different areas and grouped together. They can be associated with multiple **Epics**. |
| Scrum Task | A small, undivided, ‘chunk’ of work to be accomplished. Tasks organise how the Stories with get "Done". |

To determine whether a Story qualifies being an epic, the **CURB** mnemonic is commonly used. It stands for Complex, Unknown, Risky, or Big. If a Story is considered a CURB for the Team to complete within one iteration, it is considered an Epic.

| | |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **C**omplex | The item might be too **complex** to be understood well enough to be committed to. |
| **U**nknown | Perhaps nobody on the team knows enough about the story. The story maybe **unknown** which does not allow the story to be committed to by the team, hence, it is an epic. |
| **R**isky   | There are too many unknowns; it is too **risky** to commit to the story without further investigation or a mitigation strategy. |
| **B**ig     | It could just be too **big** to do in one sprint, even though it is well understood. |

## Story Types

The following is a list of types in the ServiceNow Agile Development 2.0 Application

| Term          | Definition                                                   |
| :------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Development   | A Story that has Code as its primary result. Also referred to as a Coding Story. |
| Documentation | Conduct Agile Analysis on process or risk,etc. The expected result is documentation to help decide on next steps. |
| Spike         | Stories that figure out answers to tough technical or design problems. Spikes address only the problem under consideration and ignore all other concerns. |

##  Story Flow

| Term               | Definition                                                   |
| :----------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Backlog Refinement | Preparing a Backlog by adding granularity to make it ready for Planning. Remember that the goal of Backlog Refinement is that the Story becomes Ready. Sometimes referred to as "grooming". |
| Ready Story        | A shared understanding by the Product Owner and the Developers regarding the preferred level of description of Product Backlog Items introduced at Sprint Planning (referred to as Definition of Ready). |
| WIP                | The Sprint Backlog Items started but not finished            |
| Ready for testing  | That development aspect                                      |
