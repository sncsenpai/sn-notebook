# ITIL v4 Lead and Ownership Gap Analysis

## Introduction

This document provides a structured analysis of lead and ownership roles across ITIL v4 practices. Each table represents a key ITIL practice area with columns identifying:
- ITIL Practice/Area
- Service Owner (accountable for overall service delivery)
- Process Lead(s) (responsible for day-to-day operation)
- Assigned Person(s) (actual staff members assigned to roles)
- Supporting Team(s) (teams providing operational support)
- RACI Status (complete/incomplete)
- Notes (gaps, training needs, etc.)

The purpose of this analysis is to identify potential gaps in ownership and leadership across the ITIL v4 framework. This can help organizations ensure clear responsibilities and accountabilities are established across all service management practices.

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing or refining these roles:

1. **Document Clear RACI Matrices**: Develop detailed Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed (RACI) matrices for each practice
2. **Formalize Appointments**: Issue formal role appointments with documented responsibilities
3. **Avoid Excessive Overlap**: While some overlap is necessary, avoid having one person responsible for too many practices
4. **Consider Skill Sets**: Match roles to appropriate skill sets rather than just organizational position
5. **Provide Training**: Ensure all role holders receive appropriate ITIL v4 training
6. **Regular Review**: Review role assignments quarterly to identify gaps or changes needed
7. **Performance Metrics**: Establish performance metrics for each role
