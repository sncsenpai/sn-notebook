# It's Not SNOW!

This is a frustrating point that I share with other ServiceNow netizens: the oblivious professionals who insist on saying SNOW or other derivatives[^1].

Let's get one thing straight ServiceNow is... ServiceNow. It is not acceptable for a ServiceNow Consultant/Developer/Analyst/Architect to use SNOW. And that is not an opinion. ServiceNow has published their [Trademark and Copyright Guidelines](https://www.servicenow.com/trademarks.html), which specifically calls this out

> Do not abbreviate, adapt, alter, modify, translate, or animate any ServiceNow Trademarks (for example, do not abbreviate ServiceNow to “SN” or “SNOW”), nor use them in a plural or modified form.

You may, just may get away with using SN internally. But SNOW is another story. If I recall correctly, there was an asset management tool called SNOW, which got acquired by Flexera. Then there's another organisation called SnowMirror that produces data replication tools for ServiceNow. And there's a competitor called Snowflake. With that I'd just say let's avoid any potential trademark or copyright issues.

On the flipside you can say "Now Platform", to describe the application, if "ServiceNow Platform" is too long for you.

However, on a humorous note, a colleague and I have been playing with "SPlat" to abbreviate "ServiceNow Platform".[^2]

[^1]: SNow, S-Now, Snow
