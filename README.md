# My ServiceNow Notebook

I have a curmudgeon of notes all over the place, so I'm taking upon myself to collate them all in one place... and will try to organise it at the same time.

Why share it? Well, I love learning and I love sharing what I learn with my peers. What are we if we cannot help each other for the betterment of ServiceNow Implementations.

I guess some points will be debateable but I'm happy to challenge and learn more.
